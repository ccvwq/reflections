By comparing the changes in the two versions of a file, we can spot mistakes more easily without remembering where the changes were made. 

By having the access to the entire history of a file you can see how a file was subsequently developed without being the developer. Also it helps to track bugs

In my opinion by manually saving versions we can precisely commit when one big change is done,by automatically saving this process is much less likely. 

Google docs isn't ment for coding so saving multiple files in one commit isn't really a useful feature for it, on the otherhand git is used mainly by programmers who often have many files that are linked together.
