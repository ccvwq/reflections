When i initialize a new repository, the folder i'm currently in, uses git to track the former versions of my file.

I think that the staging area is a limbo of some sort, where we don't want to commit them now, but we will do it in the near future.


I can use the staging area to assure that i only commit one logical change, because I can easily compare the last commit in the repository to the staging area'slast commit. 

Branches would be helpful when I would want to implement an new experimental feature while still developing the main application, without it. 


The branch visualisation is a quick tool to see what commits are visible from each branch, and what would change if i were to commit them.

By merging two branches together we can implement new feature to the main program, when we are sure that it is stable. It is shown this way to make it easier to checkout earlier commits.
