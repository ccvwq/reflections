Having a remote repository would make it a lot easier for a group to work on a program. 

When git automatically commits, there will be a big probability that the commits
won't have one logical chance by commit

Fork - if i want to modify someone else source file wihtout commmiting to the original

Clone - If i want to copy to my computer a repository and also contribute to it

Branch - If i want to implement an experimental feature but also have a working stable version

It is useful to easily keep track of the changes that are commited.

Without using gitHub it would be much harder to colaborate. 

it's better to create a new branch when we want to propose a new feature of a
big program, and not fix bugs
